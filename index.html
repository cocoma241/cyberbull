<h1>Concept</h1>
<p>As social media becomes a part of our life. Commenting on others seems easier than ever. We can find unfriendly comments on youtube, instagram, facebook...every social media that we can find. If the hate comments are not much, some people will choose to ignore it. However, if the hate comment is in a huge amount and ugly language, sometimes even including cyberstalk, it will really affect the mental state and real life of the people that have commented. There is a huge amount of people killing themselves for long-time cyberbullying. From teenager to adult, there are too many people tortured from cyberbully and could not find someone to talk with. Because their family and friends may not think it as a big deal. This website will tell people what cyberbullying and cyberstalking, how much cyberbullying will affect people and how to define it. There will be a comment corner in the website which allow people to upload some comment or seek for help,and it will be anonymous. So people can feel free to talk, but no hate comment allow in this area.
